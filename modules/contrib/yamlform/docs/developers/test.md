Manual Test Script
------------------

This is a step-by-step guide for manually testing and reviewing every feature,
role/permission, and use case addressed by the YAML Form module.

### Notes

- Contact form will be used for most examples.
- Incognito tab is the quickest way to test anonymous access to a form/feature.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Installation

- Update settings.php to allow the yamlform_test.module to be installed.  
  `$settings['extension_discovery_scan_tests'] = TRUE;`
- Enable the YAML form and YAML form test module.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Setup 

See: development-tools.md for commands.

- Create test roles and users.
- Create test submissions.
